## **4. Configuration**

### **Configuring the Neural System**

The configuration involves setting up the necessary paths and environment variables to ensure smooth operation.

#### **Path Setup**
Ensure that all scripts and modules within the `Neural` directory are properly linked:
```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/path/to/your/Neural')
```

#### **Environment Variables**
Set any necessary environment variables in your shell or `.env` file. For example:
```bash
export NEURAL_HOME='/path/to/your/Neural'
```

## **5. Usage Instructions**

### **Running the Neural System**

To run the Neural System, you can execute the main script that integrates all the modules:
```bash
python neural_system.py
```

### **Module Descriptions**

#### **neural_system.py**
This is the central script that coordinates all neural modules. Running this script will automatically initiate the protection, debugging, and self-adjustment processes.

#### **neural_protection.py**
Handles threat detection and quarantine management. It can be run independently if needed:
```bash
python neural_protection.py
```

#### **neural_debugger.py**
Executes the advanced debugging tools. It can be invoked with:
```bash
python neural_debugger.py
```

#### **neural_self_adjust.py**
Monitors the system's performance and adjusts settings accordingly:
```bash
python neural_self_adjust.py
```
